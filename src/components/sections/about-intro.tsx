          Hi, I’m Ayan Alam, a final-year Computer Science Engineering student
          from Jharkhand, India. I’m passionate about web development and aim to
          become a skilled web developer. I work primarily with the MERN stack.
          In addition to web development, I’m also a competitive programmer,
          constantly improving my problem-solving skills and algorithms. I’m
          eager to apply my skills in web development to create impactful,
          efficient, and user-friendly applications.
